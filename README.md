# Healthbar Plugin 

HeartUnderName is a lightweight Minecraft plugin that displays a customizable health bar under players' names. It shows hearts, health percentage, and ping with support for PlaceholderAPI. You can fully control how the bar looks from the config. NPCs are ignored by default, but you can enable it in settings.
